                Iris launches ‘Carbon kickback’ incentivising clients to fight
                climate change

                Iris has launched a new global initiative dubbed the ‘Carbon
                kickback’ as part of its ongoing commitment to the planet. The
                initiative encourages clients to sign up to a new ‘client
                climate charter’ and incentivizes those who sign up with access
                to the agency’s sustainability specialists free of charge. Iris
                has set ambitious targets for its 15-office network to be
                net-zero by 2025 and now the creative innovation agency wants to
                help clients move forward in their eco journey too.
              </p>
              <p>
                A new climate charter encourages clients to take positive
                climate action by committing to 5 key principles that will help
                marketing departments contribute to the reduction of their
                organisation’s overall carbon footprint. Iris will incentivize
                clients by reinvesting any time that is saved back into their
                business, in the form of free consultancy sessions with
                sustainability specialists in their ‘Future Strategy’ team. The
                Future Strategy team has already been working with big name
                brands to develop more sustainable and socially valuable
                strategies in areas such as circularity, social purpose, carbon
                offsetting and EVs. The charter’s key focus is on rapid
                reductions in international travel, which prior to lockdown made
                up 55% of Iris’ global emissions. In 2020, Iris invested heavily
                in collaboration tools to maximise the benefits of a
                digital-first approach, and has developed a proprietary remote
                working product that has been adopted by Iris’ B2B clients. Less
                time travelling has meant more time dedicated to solving
                client’s problems, and to help sustain this ‘digital-first’
                approach post-lockdown, Iris has committed to protecting and
                reinvesting any time saved from not travelling, directly back
                into their client’s business. The agency network has set ‘carbon
                budgets’ for each office and will measure its progress via its
                inhouse data analysts. They will also invest in carbon credits
                against any emissions that cannot be avoided or reduced. Travel
                is just one of five key principles underpinning the climate
                charter, others include; commitment to sustainable production
                processes; promotion of sustainable behaviour in creative work
                produced; commitment to reporting and measuring the carbon
                impact of campaigns through ‘Ecoffectiveness’ and finally
                propelling progress through participation - by encouraging other
                agencies within the global advertising industry to adopt similar
                models, a move which is backed by The Purpose Disruptors.
                Starbucks has been named as the first agency-client partner to
                back the charter, with Iris hoping more will follow. Fellow
                networked agencies Cheil, Barbarian, BMB and McKinney have also
                pledged their commitment to the progressive initiative. Ben
                Essen, Global Chief Strategy Officer at Iris said: “In 2019,
                $1.4 trillion was spent globally on business travel - but 2020
                has shown us that we can work smarter to save time, money and
                the planet.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's our job to empower clients to take bold action in the fight
                against climate change. The carbon kickback is a tangible way
                for us to start making a difference immediately, for both Iris
                and our clients.” Reuben Arnold, Vice President of Marketing &
                Product at Starbucks EMEA, commented: “I’ve experienced
                first-hand the transformational effects of working with Iris’
                Future Strategy team in shaping how we engage customers in new
                ways, particularly in the last year and I’m proud to support the
                client climate charter.” In addition to the client charter, Iris
                has been pioneering internal policies to encourage wider carbon
                footprint reduction, such as offering its people additional
                holiday if they proactively choose to take the train or drive as
                opposed to flying for personal holidays. They have also
                collaborated with carbon measurement platform Giki to enable
                each of their people around the world to personally contribute
                to an overall reduction target. Iris has been at the forefront
                of sustainability action within the advertising industry for the
                past 3 years, leading initiatives such as Create & Strike in
                2019, and working closely with The Purpose Disruptors to create
                The Great Reset in 2020. Ben Essen, Iris’ Global Chief Strategy
                Officer is a founding member of the Advertising Association’s
                climate action working group, helping shape the strategy for ‘Ad
                Net Zero’, the industry’s plan to reach net zero by 2030. As
                part of the plan, the AA, IPA and ISBA encourage agencies to
                take part in Ecoffectiveness, a new measurement tool created by
                Ben and Elvis’ Caroline Davison, that encourages return on Co2
                to become the new measure for effectiveness in advertising.
